# Agent Instructions

- Run `npm test` after making code changes and report the results. The suite currently depends on `jest-environment-jsdom`; if the environment lacks it, note the failure explicitly.
- Floating action buttons for **Asignaciones**, **Cambios de estado**, and **Tesauro** must use background `#E34850` with white text to keep the UI consistent.
- The floating control group only shows the wizard trigger; do not recreate or reintroduce an Assistant button.
- Buttons inside the Tesauro side panel and the Tesauro Manager modal must also use the `#E34850` palette with white text.
